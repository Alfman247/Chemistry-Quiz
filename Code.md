Hello!
If you are wondering, this code can easily be changed to incorparate different questions and answers.
To change the answer, change the "if q1 == ("some random answer")" to your own answer.
Also change below it so it tells you what the right answer was if you got it wrong.
If you want the same for the questions it is basically the same but you can ask in the discussion!
